Medical Surveys iOS App
===========

This is the source code for an old app made for a college course in 2009, developed in JavaScript using [Appcelerator Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/platform/titanium-sdk/). It reads JSON medical interviews and generates JSON answers. There was also a PHP website that communicated with the mobile device.
The code is half in English, half in Portuguese. I will soon test again to see if it is still working, translate, etc.
