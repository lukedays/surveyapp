Medical Surveys iOS App
------------

This is an application built for a college course in 2009, developed with JavaScript using [Appcelerator Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/platform/titanium-sdk/). Using the JSON protocol, it reads an interview file, displays an interface for the user to fill in the interview, and generates answers files. There was also a PHP website that communicated with the mobile device.
It was originally designed for medical surveys but can be used for any type of survey. The code is half in English, half in Portuguese. Screenshots are available.

To do: see if it is still working, translate, etc.
